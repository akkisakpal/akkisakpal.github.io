<h1>End-to-End ETL Pipeline with Data Validation</h1>

<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>
Raw datasets often contain inconsistencies, missing values, and schema issues that make
analysis unreliable.
</p>

<h2>Approach</h2>
<p>
Built an ETL pipeline in Python to extract raw data, apply cleaning and validation rules,
log execution steps, and output analysis-ready datasets.
</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>
Python, Pandas, logging, modular scripting
</p>

<h2>What I Learned</h2>
<p>
Reliable data pipelines are as important as modeling. Validation and observability
significantly reduce downstream errors.
